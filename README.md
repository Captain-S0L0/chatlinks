make links automatically clickable in minecraft chat

This is a simple mod to allow for links pasted into minecraft chat to be clickable, simmilarly to how they are in bukkit and its forks. Honestly, I'm not sure why this isn't a vanilla thing.

As long as the link starts with "http://" or "https://", it will correctly generate the ClickEvent, even if it is not a valid URL.

Currently built for minecraft 1.18+, but can *very* easily be backported if wanted as this isn't very version dependent.
